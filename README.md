# Asteroids

In this project I created a very simple game that moves a player using the direction keys ove enemies that disappear once they’ve been in contact with. I did this by utilizing classes, functions and for loops. I created a Game class that has an __init__ function that constructs the game. After that I have different functions that move the enemies and player, make the enemies, and make the collisions. The end result is a game, with last week’s mosaic as a background, that depicts a rocketship overtaking black square enemies.
